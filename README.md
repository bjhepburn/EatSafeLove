# EatSafeLove
Project for 'Eat Safe, Love' to evaluate UK FSA restaurant ratings.

'Eat Safe, Love' magazine has asked for information regarding a restaurants that has opened in London in order to update their readers about the new restaurant, as well as other local eateries, and also address diner's concerns over hygeinic places to eat. 

First we collect the database that ESL currently has, and update it to contain the new restaurant 'Penang Flavours' and verify that the information is consistent through a series of queries.

In the exploratory analysis, we answer:
1. Which establishments have a hygiene score higher than 20?
2. Which in London have a rating higher than 4.
3. Which establishments within a close proximity to 'Penang Flavours' have a rating of 5.
4. We look at ranking the Local Authorities by determining the number of establishments within the Local Authority with a hygiene score of 0... however, this does NOT indicate a percentage of establishments with such a rating, but rather gives a raw number, further analysis may be required to draw meaning from this value.
